From glancing the react tic tac toe tutorial, I gleamed that every one of those table cell needs to be a button.

Didn't really end up doing that, I just needed them to be clickable.

So, for every cell, I added an event handler so as to act when clicked.

Check whether the game ended for every click and display the winner if it did along with a restart button


Learnings/drawbacks:

Shouldn't have done this in an table. May be a flexbox or a grid. Need to master those, and also need to grip on wrapping content.

Am not sure about the table tag, I can't seem to properly handle the padding and margin properties of the table elements
